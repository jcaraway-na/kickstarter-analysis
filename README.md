# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

### BACKGROUND

Louise's play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset, visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### OBJECTIVE

- DELIVERABLE 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart and Summary.
- DELIVERABLE 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart and Summary.
- DELIVERABLE 3: Written analysis of any D1 vs D2 relations. Also, recommend optimal launch quarter.

#### Chart Definitions:

- ![This is an image](https://github.com/jcaraway-na/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/theater_outcome_chart_res/mrkr_successful.png) Launch date vs number of successful fundraiser outcomes.
- ![This is an image](https://github.com/jcaraway-na/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/theater_outcome_chart_res/mrkr_failed.png) Launch date vs number of failed fundraiser outcomes .
- ![This is an image](https://github.com/jcaraway-na/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/theater_outcome_chart_res/mrkr_canceled.png) Launch date vs number of canceled fundraiser outcomes.
- ![This is an image](https://github.com/jcaraway-na/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/theater_outcome_chart_res/mrkr_grand_total.png) Launch date vs total number of fundraisers per month (successful, failed, and canceled.)
- ![This is an image](https://github.com/jcaraway-na/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/theater_outcome_chart_res/optimal_launch.png)    Optimal fundraiser launch date.
- ![This is an image](https://github.com/jcaraway-na/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/theater_outcome_chart_res/optimal_fundraiser_season.png)    Optimal "LIVE" fundraiser season.

#### In Summary:

The data shows optimal fundraiser launch dates to fall in the month of April. While the optimal "LIVE" fundraiser runtime appears to fall between the months of May and August, which also shows the highest probability of successfully meeting/exceeding a campaign goal.

Louise's fundraiser was launched late into the "LIVE" fundraiser season. Therefore the Fever fundraiser campaign did not benifit from the full exposer time of the entire "LIVE" runtime season. Moving forward, when launching any new fundraisers, please take into consideration of the 2 stage fundraiser success plan. Launching in April (stage 1) will greatly benifit your fundraiser campaigns exposer time during the "LIVE" (stage 2) runtime.

## DELIVERABLE 2

### Outcomes Based on Goals Chart and Summary.

#### Chart Definitions:

#### Chart Definitions:

#### In Summary:

As illustrated in the chart and table above, we can see a clear data convergence around $10,000. With a goal of $10,000 or less, Louise should be able to successfully fund the campaign 53% of the time. The lower the campain goal is, then the more likly the goal will be met.
